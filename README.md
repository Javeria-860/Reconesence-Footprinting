During my internship, I conducted footprinting as part of an initial information-gathering process. The goal was to collect publicly available data about a target system or network to identify potential vulnerabilities.

The task involved gathering details like domain registration information, network infrastructure, and associated IP addresses. I also explored publicly accessible resources, such as websites and social media, to find valuable insights about the target organization or individuals.

Additionally, I mapped out the target's online presence by identifying exposed services, open ports, and any other accessible information that could reveal weaknesses. This process also included analyzing web infrastructure and configurations to uncover potential security gaps.

The main objective was to build a comprehensive profile of the target, which could later be used for more advanced stages of penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. This initial phase is crucial for understanding the attack surface and planning further security measures.
